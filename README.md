### Problem 5: 
The task is to design and implement methods of an LRU cache. The class has two methods get and set which are defined as follows.
get(x)   : Gets the value of the key x if the key exists in the cache otherwise returns -1
set(x,y) : inserts the value if the key x is not already present. If the cache reaches its capacity it should invalidate the least recently used item before inserting the new item.
